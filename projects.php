                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our goal of caring for the society, we took to the 
                    streets of Port Harcourt in Nigeria to address various COVID-19 related issues.
                    Face masks (some of which were donated by our partners) and other PPEs were donated
                    to people in need of them. We have also been spreading medical and government
                    information intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
